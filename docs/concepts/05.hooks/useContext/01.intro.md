# Context hooks

React Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. It's particularly useful for avoiding the need to pass props through many layers of a hierarchy.

`useContext()` is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

```javascript
const value = useContext(SomeContext);
```

To understand and master the `useContext()` hook, the user must know whats `createContext()` function is.

## How it works

1. Create a new context object with `createContext()` function. This returns a `Context` object with a `Provider` and a `Consumer`.
2. **Provider**: The `Provider` component is used high in your component tree. It allows any child components to access the context value
3. **Consumer**: The Consumer component or useContext hook is used to access the context value from a child component.
