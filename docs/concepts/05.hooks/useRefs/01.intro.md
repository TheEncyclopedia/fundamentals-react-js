# React `ref` hooks

`Refs` are a feature that allow you to persist values across renders without causing a re-render when those values change. Refs are useful for a variety of tasks, including:
-Accessing DOM nodes directly to manage focus, text selection, or media playback.
-Storing a mutable value that does not cause re-renders when updated, unlike state variables
-Keeping track of previous state values for comparison or other operations.

## Creating a ref

You can create a ref by calling `useRef` and optionally initializing it with a value. The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

function App() {
  const ref = useRef(0);

  return (...)
}

export default App;

```

`useRef`returns an object like this:

```js
{ 
  current: 0 // The value you passed to useRef
}
```

## Accessing ref

```js
// Accessing the current value
const currentRefValue = myRef.current;

// Updating the ref value
myRef.current = newValue;
```

## Why Use Refs Instead of State?

Using state to store the value of a DOM element would cause the component to re-render every time the state changes. For certain operations like managing focus or reading values (without needing to react to changes in those values), this would be inefficient. Refs provide a way to read or modify values without triggering re-renders.
