# `useRef` Hook Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `useRef` hook in React to persist values across renders without causing a re-render when those values change. The `useRef` hook is particularly useful for storing mutable values that do not trigger re-renders when they are updated.

## Code Example

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

const UseRef = () => {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  console.log('I am rendered!');

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>;
};

export default UseRef;
```

## How It Works

- Import `useRef` Hook: First, the `useRef` hook is imported from React.
- Create a Ref: A ref is created by calling `useRef(0)`, initializing it with a value of 0. This ref is used to keep track of the number of times the button is clicked.
- Handle Click: The `handleClick` function is defined to increment the current value of the ref and then display an alert showing how many times the button has been clicked.
- Rendering: The component renders a button that, when clicked, invokes the `handleClick` function.

## Key Points

- The `useRef` hook is used to create a ref object with an initial value of 0.
- The `.current` property of the ref is updated within the `handleClick` function without causing a re-render.
- Each click on the button increments the ref's `.current` value and displays an alert with the updated count.
- This example demonstrates how refs can be used to persist data across renders in a React functional component without triggering unnecessary re-renders.
