# Benefit of using Virtual DOM

Using the Virtual DOM in React and other modern JavaScript libraries offers significant performance benefits over direct DOM manipulation.

## 1. Batched DOM Update Operations

Direct DOM manipulation can be very expensive in terms of performance because each operation might trigger reflows and repaints of the webpage. The Virtual DOM improves efficiency by batching multiple DOM updates into a single reflow and repaint cycle. This means that during an update cycle, instead of updating the DOM immediately with every state change, React updates the Virtual DOM, and then the actual DOM is updated in one go, reducing the number of reflows and repaints.

### Example for scenario

Imagine a web application where the user can interact with various elements on the page, such as buttons, inputs, and dropdowns, each of which can change the state of the application. In a traditional approach, every interaction might directly update the DOM, which can lead to performance issues if the updates are frequent and involve complex DOM manipulations.

In React, when multiple state updates occur in a single synchronous execution flow, React batches these updates and applies them in a single re-render cycle for performance gains. This means that the actual DOM is updated only once at the end of the current event loop, reducing the cost of multiple reflows and repaints.

Consider a simple React component where clicking a button increments a counter multiple times:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    // Each of these state updates is batched by React
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 2);
    setCount(count + 3);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- **`onClick()` event triggered:** When the user clicks the 'Increment' button, the `handleIncrement` function is called.
- **Batched updates:** React batches the three `setCount` calls. Instead of updating  the count and re-rendering the component after each call, React updates the state once at the end of the event loop. Despite three calls to `setCount`, the component will only re-render once with the final value for the count, which will be `count + 3`
- **Performance benefit**: This approach minimizes work for the browser's rendering engine because it doesn't have to re-render the component three tree times. There's only one update cycle that happens after all state changes are made, resulting in a single reflow and repaint process.

## 2. Minimized DOM Manipulation

The Virtual DOM only updates parts of the DOM that have actually changed, minimizing the amount of DOM manipulation required. This selective update is achieved through a diffing algorithm that compares the previous and the new states of the Virtual DOM to determine the minimal set of changes needed. This significantly reduces the time and resources needed for DOM updates, which is particularly beneficial for complex applications with a lot of dynamic content.

### Example for scenario

Suppose we have a complex web page where parts of the page need frequent updates based on user interactions or incoming data, such as a live score in a sports app.

React uses the Virtual DOM to manage updates more efficiently. When a component's state changes, React updates its Virtual DOM tree. Before updating the actual DOM, it compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous version and calculates the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This process is called diffing.

Let's create a simple React component representing a sports match where only the score updates frequently, not the entire interface:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function LiveScore() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState({ home: 0, away: 0 });

  const incrementHomeScore = () => {
    setScore({ ...score, home: score.home + 1 });
  };

  const incrementAwayScore = () => {
    setScore({ ...score, away: score.away + 1 });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Match Score</h1>
      <div>Home Team: {score.home}</div>
      <div>Away Team: {score.away}</div>
      <button onClick={incrementHomeScore}>Home Team Score!</button>
      <button onClick={incrementAwayScore}>Away Team Score!</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default LiveScore;
```

- **User interaction:** When the user clicks one of the buttons to increment the score for either the home or away team, the corresponding state update function is triggered.
- **Virtual DOM Updates:** React updates the Virtual DOM with the new score for the home or away team, depending on which button was clicked.
- **Diffing Process**: React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous version. It identifies that only the text node containing the specific team's score needs to be updated.
- **Minimal DOM Updates:** Instead of re-rendering the entire match score section, React updates only the text node that actually changed in the DOM. This targeted update avoids unnecessary re-rendering of other parts of the component that havenâ€™t changed.

While Vanilla JS offers granular control and can be perfectly adequate for simple or less dynamic interfaces, React's system is designed to offer a more maintainable and performance-optimized approach, especially beneficial in complex applications with frequent UI updates. React's abstraction layer handles many of the optimization tasks automatically, allowing developers to focus more on business logic rather than performance tweaks. This makes React particularly useful for large-scale applications where performance and scalability are critical.

This targeted approach minimizes the amount of DOM manipulation required, reducing the workload on the browser's rendering engine. It allows the rest of the UI to remain intact, providing a more efficient update process. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in applications with many small, frequent updates, as it prevents extensive and unnecessary re-rendering, leading to better performance and smoother user experiences.

## 3. Improved user experience

Faster DOM updates result in smoother interactions and transitions, providing a better user experience. This is especially noticeable in highly interactive applications, such as games or complex user interfaces, where performance can be critical.

## 4. Less browser overhead

Because changes are applied in batches and only necessary updates are made, there is less load on the browser, which can lead to better overall performance of the application. This is crucial for lower-powered devices and can contribute to longer battery life on mobile devices.

As Pete Hunt says in this video, "React is not magic. Just like you can drop into assembler with C and beat the C compiler, you can drop into raw DOM operations and DOM API calls and beat React if you wanted to. However, using C or Java or JavaScript is an order of magnitude performance improvement because you don't have to worry...about the specifics of the platform.
