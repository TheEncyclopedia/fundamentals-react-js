# Javascript XML - JSX

JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to XML or HTML and is used to describe the UI structure.

- **Transpilation:** JSX isn't valid JavaScript, so tools like Babel are used to transpile JSX into JavaScript functions.

  ```jsx
  const element = (
     <div>
      <p>React is awesome</p>
    </div>
  );
  ```

  Transpiles to:

  ```js
  // React.createElement(tagName, attributes, prop)
  React.createElement("div", {}, React.createElement("p", null, "React is awesome"));
  ```

 -`react.createElement()`: This function creates a plain JavaScript object called a React element, which describes the DOM node and its properties.
