# How React Works

React's internal workings involve a combination of creating a virtual representation of the UI, efficiently updating this representation when data changes, and then reconciling these changes with the real DOM in the most performance-efficient way possible. The use of the Virtual DOM, Fiber architecture, and various optimization techniques allows React to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

By understanding these internal processes, developers can write more efficient React code, optimize performance, and better debug issues when they arise

## Diffing Algorithm

The diffing algorithm is central to the reconciliation process. It focuses on:

1. Elements of different types: React discards the entire old DOM tree and builds a new one from scratch.
2. DOM elements of the same type.
3. Component elements of the same type.
4. Recursing on children: Analyzing deeper levels of the DOM tree.

## Reconciliation

Reconciliation is a key feature of React that updates the DOM efficiently by only making necessary changes. It is a complex process, but it can be summarized in the following steps:

1. React creates a virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
2. With every change in component state or props, React creates a new virtual DOM.
3. A diffing algorithm compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to identify changes.
4. Only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM, optimizing performance and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Recap

1. The primary goal of React is to minimize the cost by efficiently updating DOM based on state changes.
2. React employs a Virtual DOM, which serves as a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. The `createElement(type, props, ...children)` function is used to generate an object version of an HTML tag, forming a Virtual DOM tree. However, the Virtual DOM itself is not just a JSON version of the current DOM, it's an in-memory representation used to compute updates efficiently.
3. React maintains two Virtual DOMs: one representing the previous state and one representing the updated state.
4. In modern development, React is often used with JSX, which allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. JSX is ultimately transformed into createElement() function calls, generating the Virtual DOM.
5. Although React may not inherently be faster, its optimization techniques significantly enhance frontend application performance.

  7.1. A state change occurs
  7.2. The diffing algorithm detects a difference between 2 Virtual DOMs
  7.3. The reconciliation process identifies the minimal set of changes needed to update the DOM.
  7.5. The actual DOM is updated on the client side.
