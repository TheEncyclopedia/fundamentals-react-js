# Local variables vs State variable

- **Local Variables**: Local variables live only within the scope of the function and do not form part of the React component's state or props. When a local variable changes, React is not aware of this change and hence no re-rendering is triggered. In the following example any changes of the index variable will not trigger re-rendering

```jsx
    import { sculptureList } from "./data.js";
        
    export default function Gallery() {
        let index = 0;
        function handleClick() {
            index = index + 1;
        }

        let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
        
        return (
            <>
                <button onClick={handleClick}>Next</button>
                <h2><i>{sculpture.name} </i>by {sculpture.artist}</h2>
                <h3>({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})</h3>
                <img src={sculpture.url} alt={sculpture.alt} />
                <p>{sculpture.description}</p>
            </>
        );
    }
```

- **State Variables**: State variables are designed to be managed by React itself. When you change the state using `setState()` in class components or `useState()` in function component, it will inform React about some state has been changed. React then schedules a re-render and the UI is updated based on the new state during that re-render.

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state.

## React's reconciliation algorithm

When a component’s state changes, React will re-render the component and its children. The reconciliation algorithm is responsible for determining what has changed in the component tree and updating the DOM accordingly.

The reconciliation algorithm starts by comparing the virtual DOM of the previous state with the virtual DOM of the new state. If there are no differences, React will not make any changes to the real DOM. If there are differences, React will update the real DOM to match the new state.

## Conclusion

- **State Variables:** Integrated into React's architecture. A change in state is a signal to React that the component may need to be re-rendered, triggering the Reconciliation Algorithm.
- **Local Variables:** Not integrated into React’s rendering logic. They exist in the function's scope and do not signal anything to React's reconciliation process.

In a sense, React’s state variables serve as a source of truth for the component, telling React when it needs to re-render. The component listens for changes to these special variables, whereas it doesn't do so for local variables.

To summarize, the useState hook provides a simpler and more intuitive way to handle state in functional components. As with any new feature, there are best practices and nuances to learn, but the introduction of hooks has been a significant enhancement to the React library, offering a more functional and flexible way to build components.
