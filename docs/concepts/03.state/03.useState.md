# React `useState` Hook

The `useState` hook is a fundamental React hook that allows functional components to manage state. It provides a way to declare state variables in a function component, enabling dynamic updates to the componentâ€™s data and UI based on user interactions or other events.

## Importing `useState`

To use the `useState` hook, import it from the React library:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

## Syntax and Usage

The `useState` hook takes an initial state as its argument and returns an array containing two elements:

1. The **current state** value.
2. A **setter function** that updates the state.

### Basic Syntax

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

- `state`: The current state value.
- `setState`: A function that updates the state to a new value.

### Example: Counter Component

Here is a simple example of a counter that uses `useState` to track and update the count value:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initializing count state with a value of 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this example:

- `useState(0)` initializes the `count` state variable to `0`.
- `setCount(count + 1)` updates the `count` value when the button is clicked.

## Setting Initial State

You can initialize state with any data type, including:

- Primitive values (e.g., `number`, `string`, `boolean`)
- Arrays**
- Objects

### Example with an Object

```js
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Alice', age: 25 });
```

You can update part of the state object by passing a new object to the setter function:

```js
setUser({ ...user, age: 26 }); // Updates only the age property
```

## Functional Updates

When the new state depends on the previous state, you can pass a function to the setter, which receives the previous state as an argument:

```js
setState(prevState => prevState + 1);
```

This approach is especially useful for ensuring that updates based on previous state are accurately reflected, even when multiple updates occur in rapid succession.

### Example with Functional Update

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increment = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Uses functional update to ensure correct count
};
```

## Handling Multiple State Variables

You can use multiple `useState` calls within a single component to manage different pieces of state independently:

```js
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('John');
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Doe');
const [age, setAge] = useState(30);
```

Each piece of state is handled separately, making it easy to manage complex state logic.

## Rules for Using `useState`

1. **Call `useState` only at the top level**: Avoid calling it inside loops, conditionals, or nested functions to ensure consistent order across renders.
2. **Only use `useState` within React function components**: Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component or another custom hook.

## Summary

The `useState` hook is essential for managing state in React function components. By providing a simple interface to declare and update state, `useState` enables the creation of interactive and dynamic components. Whether dealing with simple values or complex objects, `useState` offers flexibility and ease of use, making it a go-to tool for React developers.
