# React state hooks

React introduced Hooks in version 16.8 to provide a more direct API for several features previously restricted to class components. One of the most commonly used hooks is the `useState()` hook, which allows you to add state management to function components.

React has a mechanism called the "Reconciliation Algorithm", which intelligently determines when the DOM should be updated. React does this by building a virtual DOM tree to represent the UI. When state or props change, React builds a new virtual DOM tree and then compares it with the previous one. After the comparison, React updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This ensures efficient rendering.
