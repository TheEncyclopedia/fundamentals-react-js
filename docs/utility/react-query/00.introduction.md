# Tanstack Query (React-query)

TanStack Query (FKA React Query) is often described as the missing data-fetching library for web applications, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your web applications a breeze.

While most traditional state management libraries are great for working with client state, they are not so great at working with async or server state. This is because server state is totally different. For starters, server state:

- Is persisted remotely in a location you may not control or own
- Requires asynchronous APIs for fetching and updating
- Implies shared ownership and can be changed by other people without your knowledge
- Can potentially become "out of date" in your applications if you're not careful

Once you grasp the nature of server state in your application, **even more challenges will arise** as you go, for example:

- Caching... (possibly the hardest thing to do in programming)
- Deduping multiple requests for the same data into a single request
- Updating "out of date" data in the background
- Knowing when data is "out of date"
- Reflecting updates to data as quickly as possible
- Performance optimizations like pagination and lazy loading data
- Managing memory and garbage collection of server state
- Memoizing query results with structural sharing

React Query will likely:

- Help you remove many lines of complicated and misunderstood code from your application and replace with just a handful of lines of React Query logic.
- Make your application more maintainable and easier to build new features without worrying about wiring up new server state data sources
- Have a direct impact on your end-users by making your application feel faster and more responsive than ever before.
- Potentially help you save on bandwidth and increase memory performance
