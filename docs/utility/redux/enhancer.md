# Redux Enhancer

In Redux, an enhancer is a higher-order function that can modify the Redux store. It's used to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware, time travel, persistence, etc. Redux provides a createStore function for creating a store, and this function can take an enhancer as one of its arguments.

The primary use case for enhancers in Redux is to add middleware to the store. Middleware in Redux is used for logging actions, performing side effects like asynchronous API calls, or even modifying actions or state before they reach the reducer.

## Primary use

## Key rules and Guidelines

- **High-Order Function**: An enhancer must be a higher-order function that takes the `createStore()` function as a parameter. This requirement is crucial for enhancers to gain control over the store creation process. By receiving `createStore` as an argtument, enhancers can alter or augment the store's creation behavior. This approach enables not only the modification of reducers but also the interaction withor alteration of other aspects of store creation, including the incorporation of additional enhancer.

- **Compose Enhacers Carefully**: When using multiple enhancers, they should be composed carefully. Redux provides compose function to combine several enhancer functions into a single enhancer. This ensures that enhancers work harmoniously without conflicting with each other.

- **Middleware vs Enhancers**: It's important to distinguish between middleware and enhancers. Middleware is specifically for extending Redux with custom functionality before actions reach reducers, typically used for asynchronous operations or side effects. Enhancers, on the other hand, have broader capabilities, including the application of middleware.

- **Immutable Staet enforcement**: If your enhancer interacts with the state, ensure it maintains the principle of immutability. Enhancers should not directly modify the state; instead, they should return new state objects when changes are necessary.

- **Performance Considerations**: Be mindful of the performance impact of enhancers. Some enhancers, especially those that add logging or dev tools, can significantly affect performance if not used judiciously, especially in production environments.
