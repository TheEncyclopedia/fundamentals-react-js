# `compose(...Function)`

`compose()` is a utitility funciton in Redux library. It let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code.

reference: <https://redux.js.org/api/compose>

- Lets assume there were 3 functions that processes a string.

  ```javascript
  const makeLouder = (string) => string.toUpperCase();
  const repeatThreeTimes = (string) => string.repeat(3);
  const embolden = (string) => string.bold();
  ```

- In ordirany way with vanilla JS wto process a single string with 3 of them consecitively we would do something like this:

  ```javascript
  const makeLouderRepeatThreeTimesAndEmbolden = (string) =>
    embolden(repeatThreeTimes(makeLouder(string)));
  console.log(
    "Nested value:",
    makeLouderRepeatThreeTimesAndEmbolden(stringValue)
  );
  ```

- With `compose()` function we can do it alternatively.

  ```javascript
  const composedValue = compose(embolden, repeatThreeTimes, makeLouder);
  console.log("Composed value: ", composedValue(stringValue));
  ```
