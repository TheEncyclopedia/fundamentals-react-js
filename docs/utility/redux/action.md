# Redux action

An action is a plain JavaScript object that represents an intention to change the state. It must have a type property to indicate the type of action being performed.

## Key Points

- Payload: Actions can optionally have a payload that carries data necessary for the state update.
- Creator Functions: Action creators are functions that create and return action objects, making it easier to dispatch consistent actions.
