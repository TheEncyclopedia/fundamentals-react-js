# Redux Documentation

Redux is a state management library commonly used with JavaScript frameworks like React. It provides a predictable state container for managing application state in a single source of truth. Redux helps developers manage state efficiently, particularly in medium to large applications where state management can become complex.

## Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The application state is stored in an object tree within a single store.
2. **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions.
3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, returning the next state.

## Key Concepts

### Store

The store is the central repository of state in a Redux application.

- **Methods**:
  - `getState()`: Returns the current state of the application.
  - `dispatch(action)`: Dispatches an action to change the state.
  - `subscribe(listener)`: Adds a change listener.

### Actions

Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the application. They must have a `type` property.

Example:

```js
{
  type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER',
  payload: { amount: 1 }
}
```

### Reducers

Reducers specify how the application state should change in response to an action. A reducer is a pure function.

Example:

```jsx
function counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT_COUNTER':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + action.payload.amount };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### Middleware

Middleware allows you to perform side effects like asynchronous operations. Common middleware includes `redux-thunk` and `redux-saga`.

Example with `redux-thunk`:

```jsx
const fetchUser = (userId) => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_REQUEST' });
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', payload: data });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_FAILURE', payload: error });
    }
  };
};
```

## Setting Up Redux

### Install Redux and React-Redux

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
```

### Create Store

```jsx
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <YourComponent />
    </Provider>
  );
}
export default App;
```

### Using Redux in Components

#### Connecting to State

```jsx
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.count);
  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
}
```

#### Dispatching Actions

```jsx
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

function Counter() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER', payload: { amount: 1 } })}>
      Increment
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of using Redux by providing utilities for creating slices, reducers, and actions.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

### Create a Slice

```jsx
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment(state, action) {
      state.count += action.payload.amount;
    },
    decrement(state, action) {
      state.count -= action.payload.amount;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### Configure Store

```jsx
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterReducer },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep the state minimal and normalized.
2. Use middleware for side effects and asynchronous logic.
3. Leverage Redux Toolkit to reduce boilerplate.
4. Write unit tests for reducers and selectors.
