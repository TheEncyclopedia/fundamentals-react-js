# Essential packages to React library

## `react` package

The `react` package contains only the functionality necessary to define React components. It is typically used together with a React renderer like `react-dom` for the web, or `react-native` for the native environments.

- `react`: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react>

## `react-dom` package

This package serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. It is intended to be paired with the generic React package, which is shipped as react to npm

- `react-dom`: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom>
- `react-dom/client` doc : <https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client>
